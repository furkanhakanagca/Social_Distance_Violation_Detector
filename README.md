# Social Distance Violation Detector

The social distance violation project was carried out by the dISTance team consisting of Furkan, Ege and Tuğçe. The aim of the project is to ensure that people who violate social distance are detected quickly and automatically.

In Turkey and around the world since the beginning of the pandemic, the adaptation to the social distance rule is one of the most highlighted issues. Although the definition of distance varies from country to country, the goal is to prevent the spread of the virus by maintaining a certain distance. The goal of this project is to make people more aware of social distance, to reduce the workload of the officers who monitor the social distance rule, and to make it easier to take special measures for places where social distance is not respected.

During the implementation phase of the project, firstly, information about deep learning and image processing was obtained from online platforms such as Github and from the courses given by the coding instructors and assistants. After the information obtained, the first step of the project, the model selection and the selection of the algorithms, were made. In this section, Tensorflow models, which are frequently used in the field of image processing, were applied and from these models, the most suitable two models were selected for the project. After the model selection was completed, the tests were made and the project was completed.
